# TO DO : Add in steps with pictures from F2F here

- Metadata sheet is automatically generated
- Metadata sheets pre-filled when applicable and RFC-defined attributes are included 
- Metadata can be filled in and stored offline
- Metadata is validated & associated with selected dataset on submission

Filling in the templates:

Note that you can also save the spreadsheet as a CSV file and use a method of your choice to fill it out. The metadata CSV will be validated by the Data Curator app before submission in any case.
  

Once filled in, you can save your spreadsheet as a CSV (File -> Download -> Comma-separated Value...)

### Verify That Your Metadata Has Successfully Submitted

You can verify that both your dataset and metadata have been successfully submitted to the DCC by navigating to the Synapse project containing your dataset. The link to the project was provided by your DCC liaison in stage 1; the link is also generated by the DataCurator app above, in stage 2, if your metadata submission is successful.

If your dataset has been successfully submitted, under the Table tab of your project, there would be a table named 'hta-x-dataset', containing the list of files in your dataset and their metadata.
