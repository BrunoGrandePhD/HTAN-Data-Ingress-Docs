Using the Data Ingress App, you can annotate and submit your metadata.

# TO DO : Add in steps with pictures from F2F here

- Metadata sheet is automatically generated
- Metadata sheets pre-filled when applicable and RFC-defined attributes are included 
- Metadata can be filled in and stored offline
- Metadata is validated & associated with selected dataset on submission

### Verify That Your Metadata Has Successfully Submitted

You can verify that both your dataset and metadata have been successfully submitted to the DCC by navigating to the Synapse project containing your dataset. The link to the project was provided by your DCC liaison in stage 1; the link is also generated by the DataCurator app above, in stage 2, if your metadata submission is successful.

If your dataset has been successfully submitted, under the Table tab of your project, there would be a table named 'hta-x-dataset', containing the list of files in your dataset and their metadata.
